# Automatic_Water_Tank_Level_Controller
In this Arduino based automatic water level indicator and controller project we are going to measure the water level by using ultrasonic sensors. Basic principal of ultrasonic distance measurement is based on ECHO. When sound waves are transmitted in environment then they return back to the origin as ECHO after striking on any obstacle. So we have to only calculate its traveling time of both sounds means outgoing time and returning time to origin after striking on any obstacle. And after some calculation we can get a result that is the distance. This concept is used in our water controller project where the water motor pump is automatically turned on when water level in the tank becomes low.
